I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/home). I am broadly interested in the area of machine learning, including reinforcement learning, online learning (in particular, multi-armed bandit) and representation learning.

Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. from [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (headed by [Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)), Tsinghua University in June 2023. During my Ph.D. study, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/) and also work closely with [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/) (Director of [MSR Asia Theory Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msr-asia-theory-center/)).

I visited Cornell University in person during September-December 2022, where I was lucky to be supervised by [Prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/). I was also a research intern at [MSR Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) during January-May 2020, supervised by [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/).


<!-- My research focuses on designing both computationally and statistically efficient bandit and RL algorithms, establishing rigorous theoretical analysis, and expanding online learning and RL theories. -->

<!-- My committee members are [Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/) (MSRA, IEEE Fellow), [Wei Chen](https://weichen-cas.github.io/) (CAS), [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/) (Tsinghua), [Jian Li](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/) (Tsinghua) and [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) (Tsinghua, IEEE Fellow). -->
