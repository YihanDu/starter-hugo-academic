I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of Tsinghua University, headed by [Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/) and work closely with [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/) (IEEE Fellow, [MSR Asia Theory Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msr-asia-theory-center/) Director).  

I am visiting Cornell University from September 2022, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/). I was a research intern at MSR Asia from January 2020 to May 2020, supervised by [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/). 

I am broadly interested in online learning (in particular, multi-armed bandit) and reinforcement learning (RL). 
My research focuses on designing both computationally and statistically efficient bandit and RL algorithms, establishing rigorous theoretical analysis, and expanding online learning and RL theories.
