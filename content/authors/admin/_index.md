I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the ESD pillar of the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). My research interests focus on machine learning, including reinforcement learning (RL), online learning (in particular, bandits) and multi-task learning. Recently, I am interested in the application of RL and bandits in LLMs (e.g., RLHF and DPO), and diffusion models for decision making.

Previously, I was a postdoc at UIUC, advised by [Prof. R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/home) (IEEE Fellow) during 2023-2025. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [IIIS, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (headed by [Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)) in June 2023, advised by [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/). I visited Cornell University in person in Fall 2022, working with [Prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/), and was a research intern at [MSR Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) during January-May 2020, mentored by [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/) (ACM/IEEE Fellow, Director of MSR Asia Theory Center). In my research works, I collaborate with industry including Nvidia and Microsoft.

<font color="red">I am actively looking for Ph.D. students with full scholarship (2026 Spring or Fall), research interns, and visiting scholars.</font> If you are interested in working with me, feel free to email me with your CV, and several sentences describing your background and available time period. 

I am a hands-on mentor. I co-mentored two undergraduate students with my Ph.D. advisor before, and both projects were published on top conferences NeurIPS and ICLR (the student is the first author).
